# Gobblet Game AI Player


## Development Guidelines
- Variable names
    + snake_case (all small separated by underscores, and begins by a noun), e.g `game_state`
    + try to avoid single/double chars variable names, make it meaningful  
- Function/Method names 
    + snake_case (all small separated by underscores, and begins by a verb), e.g `update_game_state`
    + try to add a doc string to explain what function does 
- Class names 
    + Pascal_Snake_Case, or Title_Case , e.g `State`, `Play_Button`
- Constants 
    + ALL_CAPS, e.g `RADIUS_OF_EARTH`
    + if there is a lot of constants place them in separate file 
- Function/Method length 
    + try to limit the function size to 60 lines maximum
